Building and Running
--------------------

In order to build and run JXTA JSE you will require Java SE 5.0 
(http://java.sun.com./javase/downloads/index_jdk5.jsp) and Apache Ant 1.6 
(http://ant.apache.org). Both must be installed and configured to run in your
environment.

Once installed, you can view the build options as follows:

You can build and run the JXTA Platform as follows:

  Change Log
  --------------------------------------------------------
  2015-01-16
  
  - Implemented net.jxta.impl.modulemanager as wrapper around net.jxta.impl.loader.RefJxtaLoader
  - removed a lot of trivial warnings
  - Closed Base64 in- and outputpipes
  - Created net.jxta.platform and moved some files from net.jxta.peergroup to this package, in order to 
    cleanly separate configuration files (e.g NetworkConfigurator) from core jxta functionality
  - renamed jxse.OSGI packages to regular package naming conventions (OSGI to lower case) 
  - net.jxse.platform.ModuleSpecID and net.jxse.platform.ModuleClassID moved to net.jxse.peergroup.core package
